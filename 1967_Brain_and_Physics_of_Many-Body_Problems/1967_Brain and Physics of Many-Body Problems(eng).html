Summary. On the basis of a recent physical theory of
many-body problems developped in our Institute <sup>1</sup>, a model
of the brain is formulated, and it is shown how some of its
typical features, such as learning and memory processes, find
therein a natural and simple explanation. In the Appendix a
short surview of the necessary mathematical formalism is
finally given.

<h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>
        <p>
Although nowadays the study of natural and artificial
brain plays the main role among those researches
which were indicated by N. WIENER as Cybernetics,
it seems that a very few concrete results have been
obtained, in the sense that the question how the brain
works out the in]ormation received ]rom the outside, and
which is the logic on which the operations per]ormed by
the brain are based is still far from a satisfactory solution.
Several mathematical models of brains have been
formulated (McCULLOCH and PITTS, 1943 ; CAIAINIELLO,
1961; HARTH, 1966), and all of them, although apparently
more or less different, are based upon the
same assumption, partially demonstrated by electrophysiological
evidence, that significant parameters in
the description of the brain are the activity or inactivity states of its neurons, the values of their
thresholds, and the magnitude of their coupling coefficients.
Neurons are looked on as binary elements,
whose output can be described by a two-valued function
which, after obvious normalization, is usually represented
by the Heaviside unit step-function. In this
way, it is possible (CAIANlELLO, 1961) to write a
system of N nonlinear algebraic equations (where N
is the number of neurons) which once solved after
specification of couplings and thresholds, furnish the
instantaneous behaviour of the nerve net.
        </p>
        <p>
Models of this type are particularly useful in order
to design machines, whose fundamental elements are
artificial neurons, able to perform preassigned operations,
as for instance pattern recognition; they also
contain the possibility of introducing learning processes,
and of explaining memory as due to the time variation
of the coupling coefficients and to the formation of
periodical activity patterns in the firing of neurons
(CAIANIELLO, 1961). It seems very appropriate to indicate
these models as simulators of neuronal networks.
Being a very drastic idealization of the reality, they represent a powerful tool of investigation of the neuron
dynamics, and moreover they offer undeniable advantages
in machine-designing problems, i.e. in designing
active networks characterized by certain specific
features. However, in the case of natural brains, it
might be pure optimism to hope to determine the
numerical values for the coupling coefficients and the
thresholds of all neurons by means of anatomical or
physiological methods. Moreover, as soon as one asks
the question whether or not these models can be looked
on as models of the true brain, many questions immediately
arise. First of all, a t which level should the
brain be studied and described ? I n other words, is i t
essential to know the bchaviour in time of any single
neuron in order to understand the behaviour of natural
brains ? Probably the answer is negative. The behaviour
of any single neuron should not be significant for
the functioning of the whole brain, otherwise a higher
and higher degree of malfunctioning should be observed,
unless to assume the existance of "special"
neurons, characterized by an exceptionally long half
life : or to postulate a huge redundancy in the circuitry
of the brain. However, up to our knowledge, there have
been no evidences which show the existence of such
"special" neurons, and to invoke the redundancy is
not the best way to answer the question.
        </p>
        <p>
Another possibility is the following one : the activity
of any single neuron is not significant, but rather the
patterns of activity of clusters of them; what is important is only a "quantity" somehow related to the
activity of the whole cluster, which does not change
appreciably as function of the number of alive neurons
belonging to that cluster. However, apart from the
difficulties offered by the latter hypothesis, it is easily
seen that it also contains the same difficulty as the
one present in the former. Moreover, any effort to
support any hypothesis of this type by means of
anatomo-physiological evidence, for the time being,
does not seem to be successful.
        </p>
        <p>
Another remark which seems rather important is
that neurons do not seem to be the only fundamental
units of the brain; or, at least, together with them
some other elements, as for instance glia cells, may
play important r61c (ARBIB, 1964; SCHMITT, 1966).
        </p>
        <p>
From all the previous considerations, it again
emerges t h a t the proposed simulators of brain may
be useful only in order to design "thinking machines"
able to perform preassigned tasks, and although all of
them stemed from some anatomical and physiological
evidence, they cannot be looked on as describing the
true dynamics of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
Then, another possible approach to the braindynamics
naturally arises. The point of departure is
that even though the elementary entities like neurons
and others could be the most fundamental, their
dynamical behaviour may be so complicated that many of their original features may become hidden under
the macroscopic dynamics of the brain as a whole.
This hypothesis has been recently supported by some
beautiful experimental results obtained by JOHN
(1966); he clearly demonstrated that the existence of
similar and almost simultaneous responses in several
regions of the brain (a kind of long range correlation)
to a particular stimulation technique does not find any
explanation in terms of activity of the single nerve
cells: new non-classical mechanisms have to be looked
for. I t then arises naturally a possibility: since one
usually ignores the mechanism according to which the
brain performs intelligent operations, but only hypothesis
(even though interesting and sometimes useful
(REICHARDT, 1957) can be formulated, one could try
to give a more general description of the brain dynamics;
as we shall see later, from a phenomenological
point of view it is strongly suggestive of a quantum
model. In other terms, one can try to look for specific
dynamical mechanisms (already known in physics of
many degrees of freedom) which can satisfy the essential
requirements of the observed functioning of
the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
In the following, we shall first examine which are
the essential requirements to be satisfied by a model
of the brain, and we shall later see how an already
existing physical theory can be used in order to give
a quantum description of the brain, such to take into
account well recognized features of the living beings,
as the capacity of learning and of remembering; moreover,
the existence of long range correlations automatically
finds an explanation in the theory itself.
        </p>
<h2><center>II. Some Necessary Requirements to be Satisfied by a Model of Brain</center></h2>
        <p>
One of the most typical features of the brain
is the capacity of remembering, that is of storing information
patterns for a more or less long time interval.
More precisely, there seems a great deal of evidences
for the existence of essentially two types of
memories, i.e., a long-term and a short-term memory
(ARBIB, 1964; SCHMITT, 1966), and it appears that we
have to retain an idea for quite a while in a short
term memory before it is transferred into long-term
memory.
        </p>
        <p>
How can we account for memory ? The brain is
estimated to contain \(10^{10}\) neurons and ten times that
many glia cells, which closely invest the neurons and
the blood vessels. Many neurons receive hundreds or
thousands of fiber connections from other neurons
(BRAITENBERG et al. 1965). The resulting neuronal nets
are too comphcated to be explored with the microscope,
and experts estimate that only a few per cent of the
connections have actually been traced (SCHMITT,
1966), and these myriad "nets-within-nets" are particularly
complex and numerous in the brain cortex,
the region most intimately associated with higher
mental functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
Especially long term memory, learning and other
higher nervous functions have been thought to result
from impulses traversing such complex neuronal nets,
and individual long term memories could have their
physical explanation in ceaseless reverberatory passage
of impulses, each in its particular net (SCHMITT, 1966).
        </p>
        <p>
However, there seems to be some serious objections.
Bioelectrical waves in the brain can be stopped by treatment with cold, electric shock, or drugs, without
loss of memory after recovery, and moreover, memory
is not lost after many ablation experiments or when
a brain is sliced in many directions so that certainly
some pre-existent networks are distroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
These facts suggest that memories are not "wired"
into individual neuronal nets, but are instead diffused
in the brain (SCHMITT, 1966). The first net that corresponds
to an incoming message has its information
transferred to other nets often far from the original
location of the stimuli carrying the message.
        </p>
        <p>
In this framework, it automatically emerges the
possibility of observing some kind of correlations between
the activities of neurons (at present neurons
are much more easily observed than other systems or
"entities") even though they are situated in places
far from each other, and this has been supported by
experimental evidence (BRAITENBERG, 1965; RICCIARDI,
1966).
        </p>
        <p>
Another remark has finally to be made: it seems
that no conscious simultaneous recall of several memorized
inlormations is possible; more precisely, there
are good reasons to believe that the stored information
can be recalled according to serial processes rather
than in parallel, and, as it is well known, often it
happens that as soon as something has been remembered,
further and sometimes unrelated informations
are recalled, too. Also this last remark, as it will soon
be seen, finds its natural explanation in the model
that we are going to propose.
        </p>
<h2><center>III. Outline of the Model</center></h2>
        <p>
In this section we will be concerned with the essential
requirements to be satisfied by a model which
describes the brain as a collection of very many mutually
interacting units. As it will clearly appear in the
following, the model is firmly based on the experimental
evidence which was mentioned in the previous
sections. In the forgoing, while exposing the logical
steps to be done in order to construct our model, we
will see how naturally our argument follows the line
of an already well founded physical theory; from the
latter, in order to give a deeper development of our
model, the necessary mathematical tools can be
derived.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us look at the brain as a system in interaction
with the external world; from the latter it receives
stimuli, and as a consequence of it the system is put
into particular states. A first requirement is that theso
stimuli should be in some way coded and their effects
should be represented into the brain also after they
have ceased; this implies that the brain, as effect of
the received stimulations, changes its state; the states
may be described by a suitable set of variables, which
in the following according to the physical terminology
we will call "dynamical variables ". In the usual models
of brain these variables may be for instance identified
with the binary variables describing the activity or
inactivity states of the neurons. However, for the
previously mentioned reasons, here we do not intend
to consider necessarily the neurons as the fundamental
units in the brain; therefore, our variables should be
thought as related to a certain (very large) number of
entities, essential for producing the different states of
the brain; their nature does not here need to be
analysed. To be precise, our variables must be such to describe the stationary or quasi-stationary states of
the isolated brain. According to the usual terminology
of Quantum Mechanics, such states can be classified
in terms of quantum numbers associated with the invariance
of the system under certain transformations <sup>2</sup>.
We can than assume the specification of the quantum
number as the code itself; moreover only those variables
which do not change under invariant transformations
will be responsible for the storing of the information
represented by the corresponding code.
        </p>
        <p class="margin-large">
            <sup>2</sup> The reader is reminded, for instance, of the angular momentum associated with spherical symmetry.
        </p>
        <p>
These variables must be classified into sets (henceforth
called independent sets) which transform independently
under a given invariant transformation;
these sets, in turn, can be labelled by the quantum
numbers <sup>3</sup>. Moreover the classification of the independent
sets depends on the choice of the invariant
transformations, since in general there may exist
several non-commutative invariant transformations <sup>4</sup>.
        </p>
        <p class="margin-large">
            <sup>3</sup> For example the spin doublet has 1/2 spin quantum number, associated with the spin rotation.<br>
            <sup>4</sup> For instance, this happens in the case of rotations in manyfold spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
According to different stimuli, these variables are
changed to create excited states of the quantum
numbers associated to them; already at this stage the
information coming to the system from the outside
is coded into the brain. Since the first requirement for
memory processes is the stability, the code should be
later on transferred to the ground state of the system.
This can be achieved by means of condensation into
the ground state of the coded information already held
by the excited states. Such a condensation can then
give account of learning processes.
        </p>
        <p>
The previously invoked condensation finds its explanation
in the Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon,
well known in the physics of many-body problems.
More in detail, the condensation of Bose particles
with a specific quantum number transfers to the ground
state the quantum number itself (for instance, the
Bose condensation of spin wave in the case of ferromagnetism
creates the polarized ground state). This
arguments requires the existence in the brain of variables
obeying the Bose-statistics. Such variables should
also posses long range property in order to supply the
code to the brain system itself and to maintain it. In
other words, the interaction of such a complex system
consisting of a huge number of entities, has as its effect
the creation of the long range Boson correlation which
regulates the brain dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
In the terminology of physics, what the present
model proposes is that the brain function is a manifestation
of spontaneous break-down of various symmetries
in brain dynamics and the long range Bosons
mentioned above correspond to the so called Goldstone
quanta.
        </p>
        <p>
By means of the previous description, long term
memory is related to the ground state; short-term
memories can instead be related to the existence of
meta.stable excited states.
        </p>
        <p>
The description of the brain as a system of an
enormous number of interacting entities, offers also
another advantage: the gross properties of the system
should not change appreciably under destruction of a
considerable number of units, which, instead, as we mentioned before, has a catastrophic effect for the
usual brain simulators.
        </p>
        <p>
A final remark is that from our argument one should
expect correlations also among the neurons' activity,
which, as we said before, recently has been already
observed.
        </p>
<h2><center>IV. Concluding Remarks</center></h2>
        <p>
Although the outlined model only represents the
start point of further theoretical researches, already at
this stage some additional remarks, which spontaneously
emerge from the previously sketched theory, are to
be done.
        </p>
        <p>
The existence of long range correlation, by means
of which fundamental properties of the brain, as memory
processes, find an explanation, seems to be supported
by experimental evidence <sup>5</sup> (John, 1966). Moreover,
it also suggests the existence of different types
of short-term memory processes. In the previous section,
indeed, we interpreted short term memory as
related to transitions between excited states. Such an
interpretation has the advantage of giving reason for
the so often observed "association of ideas"; moreover,
the fact that memory is associated with the
states of the brain system, leads us to predict that
several codes cannot be transferred to the brain at
the same time, and it would be useful to recall here
that psychological experiments seem to show that
several memory processes may not take place simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p class="margin-large">
        <sup>5</sup> An extremely stable type of memory, as it is well known, seems to be linked with the genetic code contained in the structure of DNA-molecules. The proposed model can be utilized also in order to describe the genetic mechanisms, and again one may account for stability by means of the condensation of the long range correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
Also another possibility is offered, indeed, for the
explanation of the short term memory. As a matter
of fact, we may consider the brain as consisting of
several regions; our previous argument may then be
applied to each of these regions, considered as physically
disjoined. However, because of the existence of
long range correlation in our model, these regions
should not be ]unctionally separated, and therefore
the code held by one of them may be destroyed or
modified because of the influence of the other regions.
        </p>
        <p>
Another remark is the following: as we said in
See. 3, the classification of the independent sets depends
on the choice of the invariant' transformations,
because of the possible existence of several non commutative
invariant transformations. This situation,
which is an obvious property of some descriptions of
many-body problems, provides in this context an explanation
for the often observed "many-to-one" type
response of living beings under given stimulations, and
at the same time it accounts for the destructive or
associative correlations in memory processes.
        </p>
        <p>
To conclude, we wish to remark that our present
knowledge of the brain and of the microscopic processes
therein involved does not yet permit us to guess which
types of invariance may be present, even though a high
number of them should certainly exist; therefore, for
the moment we prefer not to anticipate anything. However
we want to point out that often in many-body
problems the possible types of invariance are suggested
just by inspection of the properties of the long range
correlation; and also in the case of the brain we feel 
        </p>
        <p>
that following this way we will eventually obtain encouraging
results.
        </p>
<h2><center>Appendix <sup>6</sup></center></h2>
        <p class="margin-large">
            <sup>6</sup> In this Appendix we present a very brief sketch of the mathematics on which our model is based. The interested reader, however, will find a complete treatment of the theories of the type utilized in the text in UMEZAWA (1966) (which is easy readable also by the non-specialists), LEPLAE et al., (1966) and UMEZAWA (1965). Detailed mathematical considerations on the Bose condensation will be found in ARAKI and WOODS (1963) and EZAWA (1965). Finally, a simple presentation of the many-body problems in terms of our framework can be found, for instance, in HENLEY and THIRRING (1962).
        </p>
        <p>
Let us consider a set \(\{X_i(\vec{x},t)\}\) of dynamical variables
describing stationary or quasi-stationary oscillations;
by \(\vec{x}\) and t we denote the position and the
time respectively. According to the terminology of
Quantum Mechanics, stationary oscillations can be
described by harmonic oscillators, while the quasi-stationary oscillations are represented by damped oscillators.
These oscillators are described by the set of
real variables \(\{X_i(\vec{x}, t)\}\) already introduced, together
with their canonical conjugates \(\{X_i(\vec{x}, t)\}\) ; index \(i\) may
in general assume both discret and continuous values.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us now indicate by \(n_i (n_i = 0 , 1, 2, . . . )\) the
principal quantum number; the corresponding energy
\(E_i\) is then of the form:
\[
E_i=n_i\omega_i　(n_i=0,1,2,...)
\]
where \(omega_i\) denotes the energy of the oscillation. Since
we are concerned only with long half-life quasi stationary
oscillations, we will consider them, in a first
approximation, as stationary oscillations.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us now consider the variables Xi as obeying
the Bose statistics <sup>7</sup>; this implies that the following
commutation relations hold:
        </p>
        <p class="margin-large">
            <sup>7</sup> By this we do not mean that the Bosons represent original constituents of the brain, but rather we assume the existence of a mapping between the original variables and the Xi here introduced. Moreover, let us stress that Bosons do not represent a pure speculative fiction; in fact from their observed properties we must be able to identify them as realistic entities. In this respect a very urgent and significant problem is to measure the energy spectrum of the long range correlation.    
        </p>
        <p>
\[
[X_i(\vec{x},t),X_j(\vec{y},t)]=i\hbar\delta_{ij}\delta(\vec{x}-\vec{y})
\]
Let us now construct the new variables \(\xi_j\). defined as <sup>8</sup> :
        </p>
        <p class="margin-large">
            <sup>8</sup> When no risk of ambiguity arises, for simplicity we will
drop the argument \((\vec{x}, t)\).
        </p>
        <p>
\[
\xi_j=\frac{X_j+iX_j}{2}
\]
Their hermitic conjugate \(\xi_j^\dagger\) are then given by
\[
\xi_j^\dagger=\frac{X_j-iX_j}{2}
\]
and between the \(\xi_i\)'s and \(\xi_j^\dagger\)'s the following commutation
relations hold:
\[
[\xi_i(\vec{x},t),\xi_j^\dagger(\vec{y},t)]=i\hbar\delta_{ij}\delta(\vec{x}-\vec{y})
\tag{1}
\]
As i t is well known, the principal quantum number \(n_j\) is eigenvalue of the operator
\[
\int d^3x\xi_j^\dagger\xi_j
\]
and \(\xi_j\) depends on t only through an exponential factor
of the form
\[
\exp[-i\omega_j t]
\]
Denoting now by \(\Phi_0\) the ground state, whose energy
is regarded as zero, the states \(\xi_j^\dagger\Phi_0\) represent excited
states whose correspondent energies are \(z\omega_j\). Proceeding
in this way we may construct all the excited states.
        </p>
        <p>
The Bose-Einstein condensation appears provided
there exist certain variables \(\tilde{\xi_j}\) such t h a t their ground
state expectation values are non-zero, that is
\[
\langle\tilde{\xi}_j\rangle=\eta_j\neq 0
\tag{2}
\]
These variables \(\tilde{\xi}_j\) can then always be written in the
form
\[
\tilde{\xi}_j=\xi_j+\eta_j
\tag{3}
\]
where \(\xi_j\) are the already introduced operators.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us note that since \(\xi_j\)'s obey the Bose statistics,
the variables \(\tilde{\xi}_j\) satisfy the commutation relations (1),
and therefore they also are canonical.
        </p>
        <p>
The dynamical variables may now be classified into
independent sets which independently transform under
given invariant transformations, and each of which is
specified by its quantum number. Let us recall that
the invariant transformations are those under which
the dynamical system does not change a t all.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us now focus our attention on the independent
set containing the variables \(\tilde{\xi}_j\) which satisfy (2). Now,
since \(\tilde{\xi}_j\) carries a quantum number, because of (3) also
\(\eta_j\) does, and finally in virtue of (2) this quantum number
is given to the ground state. Intuitively speaking,
the condensation of bosons carrying a quantum number
gives origin to a ground state which maintains the
same quantum number.
        </p>
        <p>
The quantum number transmitted to the ground
state has to be identified with the code introduced in
See. 3.
        </p>
        <p>
It is obvious that any ground state of non-trivial
quantum number is not a state which is invariant
under the invariant transformations. Still, such a
ground state can appear without conflicting with the
invariant nature of the system, when the energy spectra (\(\omega_i\)) of the bosons (\(\xi_i\)) are gapless <sup>9</sup>. Here an energy
spectrum is said to be gapless when its minimum value
coincides with the energy of the ground state. The
condensation of bosons can take place without any
external energy supply when the boson energy spectra
are gapless. Since any invariant transformation can
be performed without any energy supply, the condensation
in the ground state can be regulated b y the
invariant transformations. It must be noted that the
gapless nature of the boson energy spectra is the origin
of the long range property of the boson effects <sup>10</sup> (i.e. long
range correlation).

<sup>9</sup> Remember, for example, the crystals and ferromagnets. In the crystals the interactions are invariant under spatial translations even though they crea~e the lattice structure. In the polarized magnets the interactions are invariant under the spin-rotation. In both cases there exist certain gapless bosons.<br>
<sup>10</sup> When there exists a long range potential of the Coulomb type, the boson energy spectra need not to be gapless. In such a case the long range property of the boson effects comes from that of the potential.

The excited s tates \(\xi_i^\dagger\Phi_0\), \(\xi_i^\dagger\xi_j^\dagger\Phi_0\), etc. appear under the effect of external stimuli, and since \(\xi_j\) carries
a quantum number, the excited states carry additional
quantum numbers: these represent the code of the short-term memory.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us note t h a t the excited states may decay into
lower states either because of their intrinsic instability or because of the interaction of a particular subsystem
with the neighbouring regions.
        </p>
        <p>
Let us finally recall that the invariance of the considered
dynamics under any continuous transformation
gives origin to locally conserving currents carrying
specific quantum numbers, and this is the origin of
the long range correlation. Noteworthy is the fact that
the communication of the code (i.e. of the quantum
number) is performed only by conserving currents, and
this circumstance automatically ensures the conservation
of the code, in the sense that it cannot spontaneously
disappear.
