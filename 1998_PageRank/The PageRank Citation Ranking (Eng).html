        <h1><center>The PageRank Citation Ranking:<br> 
Bringing Order to the Web </center></h1>

<center>January29,1998 </center>
<h2><center>Abstract</center></h2>
<p class="margin-abstract">
　The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the
readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively
about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a method for
rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and
attention devoted to them.<br>
　We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently
compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search
and to user navigation.
</p>

<h2>1 Introduction and Motivation</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web creates many new challenges for information retrieval. It is very large and
heterogeneous. Current estimates are that there are over 150 million web pages with a doubling
life of less than one year. More importantly, the web pages are extremely diverse, ranging from
” What is Joe having for lunch today?” to journals about information retrieval. In addition to these
major challenges, search engines on the Web must also contend with inexperienced users and pages
engineered to manipulate search engine ranking functions.
</p><p>

　However, unlike flat” document collections, the World Wide Web is hypertext and provides
considerable auxiliary information on top of the text of the web pages, such as link structure and
link text. In this paper, we take advantage of the link structure of the Web to produce a global
“importance” ranking of every web page. This ranking, called PageRank, helps search engines and
users quickly make sense of the vast heterogeneity of the World Wide Web.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Diversity of Web Pages</h3>
<p>

Although there is already a large literature on academic citation analysis, there are a number
of significant differences between web pages and academic publications. Unlike academic papers
which are scrupulously reviewed, web pages proliferate free of quality control or publishing costs.
With a simple program, huge numbers of pages can be created easily, artificially inflating citation
counts. Because the Web environment contains competing profit seeking ventures, attention getting
strategies evolve in response to search engine algorithms. For this reason, any evaluation strategy
which counts replicable features of web pages is prone to manipulation. Further, academic papers
are well defined units of work, roughly similar in quality and number of citations, as well as in
their purpose — to extend the body of knowledge. Web pages vary on a much wider scale than
academic papers in quality, usage, citations, and length. A random archived message posting
﻿asking an obscure question about an IBM computer is very different from the IBM home page. A
research article about the effects of cellular phone use on driver attention is very different from an
advertisement for a particular cellular provider. The average web page quality experienced by a
user is higher than the quality of the average web page. This is because the simplicity of creating
and publishing web pages results in a large fraction of low quality web pages that users are unlikely
to read.
</p><p>

　There are many axes along which web pages may be differentiated. In this paper, we deal
primarily with one - an approximation of the overall relative importance of web pages.
</p>

<h3>1.2 PageRank</h3>
<p>

In order to measure the relative importance of web pages, we propose PageRank, a method for
computing a ranking for every web page based on the graph of the web. PageRank has applications
in search, browsing, and traffic estimation.
</p><p>
　Section 2 gives a mathematical description of PageRank and provides some intuitive justifi-
cation. In Section 3, we show how we efficiently compute PageRank for as many as 518 million
hyperlinks. To test the utility of PageRank for search, we built a web search engine called Google
(Section 5). We also demonstrate how PageRank can be used as a browsing aid in Section 7.3.
</p>

<h2>2 A Ranking for Every Page on the Web</h2>
<h3>2.1 Related Work</h3>
<p>

There has been a great deal of work on academic citation analysis [Gar95]. Goffman [Gof71] has
published an interesting theory of how information flow in a scientific community is an epidemic
process.
</p><p>

　There has been a fair amount of recent activity on how to exploit the link structure of large
hypertext systems such as the web. Pitkow recently completed his Ph.D. thesis on “Characterizing
World Wide Web Ecologies” [Pit97, PPR96] with a wide variety of link based analysis. Weiss
discuss clustering methods that take the link structure into account [WVS* 96]. Spertus [Spe97]
discusses information that can be obtained from the link structure for a variety of applications.
Good visualization demands added structure on the hypertext and is discussed in |MFH95, MF95].
Recently, Kleinberg |Kle98] has developed an interesting model of the web as Hubs and Authorities,
based on an eigenvector calculation on the co-citation matrix of the web.
</p><p>

　Finally, there has been some interest in what “quality” means on the net from a library com-
munity [Til].
</p><p>

　It is obvious to try to apply standard citation analysis techniques to the web’s hypertextual
citation structure. One can simply think of every link as being like an academic citation. So,
a major page like http://www.yahoo.com/ will have tens of thousands of backlinks (or citations)
pointing to it.
</p><p>

　This fact that the Yahoo home page has so many backlinks generally imply that it is quite
important. Indeed, many of the web search engines have used backlink count as a way to try to bias
their databases in favor of higher quality or more important pages. However, simple backlink counts
have a number of problems on the web. Some of these problems have to do with characteristics of
the web which are not present in normal academic citation databases.
</p>

﻿<h3>2.2. Link Structure of the Web</h3>
<p>

While estimates vary, the current graph of the crawlable Web has roughly 150 million nodes (pages)
and 1.7 billion edges (links). Every page has some number of forward links (outedges) and backlinks
(inedges) (see Figure 1). We can never know whether we have found all the backlinks of a particular
page but if we have downloaded it, we know all of its forward links at that time.

</p>
<center><img src="images/fig1.png"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 1: A and B are Backlinks of C</center>
</p><p>

　Web pages vary greatly in terms of the number of backlinks they have. For example, the
Netscape home page has 62,804 backlinks in our current database compared to most pages which
have just a few backlinks. Generally, highly linked pages are more “important” than pages with
few links. Simple citation counting has been used to speculate on the future winners of the Nobel
Prize [San95]. PageRank provides a more sophisticated method for doing citation counting.
</p><p>

　The reason that PageRank is interesting is that there are many cases where simple citation
counting does not correspond to our common sense notion of importance. For example, if a web
page has a link off the Yahoo home page, it may be just one link but it is a very important one.
This page should be ranked higher than many pages with more links but from obscure places.
PageRank is an attempt to see how good an approximation to “importance” can be obtained just
from the link structure.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Propagation of Ranking Through Links</h3>
<p>

Based on the discussion above, we give the following intuitive description of PageRank: a page has
high rank if the sum of the ranks of its backlinks is high. This covers both the case when a page
has many backlinks and when a page has a few highly ranked backlinks.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Definition of PageRank</h3>
<p>

Let \(u\) be a web page. Then let \(F_u\) be the set of pages \(u\) points to and \(B_u\) be the set of pages that
point to u. Let \(N_u = |F_u|\) be the number of links from u and let c be a factor used for normalization
(so that the total rank of all web pages is constant).
</p><p>

　We begin by defining a simple ranking, R which is a slightly simplified version of PageRank:

\[
R(u)=c\sum_{v\in B_u} \frac{R(v)}{N_v}
\]

</p><p>

　This formalizes the intuition in the previous section. Note that the rank of a page is divided
among its forward links evenly to contribute to the ranks of the pages they point to. Note that
\(c < 1\) because there are a number of pages with no forward links and their weight is lost from the
system (see section 2.7). The equation is recursive but it may be computed by starting with any set
of ranks and iterating the computation until it converges. Figure 2 demonstrates the propagation
of rank from one pair of pages to another. Figure 3 shows a consistent steady state solution for a
set of pages.
</p>
<center><img src="images/fig2.png"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 2: Simplified PageRank Calculation</center>
</p><p>

　Stated another way, let \(A\) be a square matrix with the rows and column corresponding to web
pages. Let \(A_{u,v} = 1/N_u\), if there is an edge from \(u\) to \(v\) and \(A_{u,v}= 0\) if not. If we treat \(R\) as a
vector over web pages, then we have \(R = cAR\). So \(R\) is an eigenvector of \(A\) with eigenvalue \(c\). In
fact, we want the dominant eigenvector of A. It may be computed by repeatedly applying A to any
nondegenerate start vector.
</p><p>

There is a small problem with this simplified ranking function. Consider two web pages that
point to each other but to no other page. And suppose there is some web page which points to
one of them. Then, during iteration, this loop will accumulate rank but never distribute any rank
(since there are no outedges). The loop forms a sort of trap which we call a rank sink.
</p><p>
To overcome this problem of rank sinks, we introduce a rank source:
</p><p>

<strong>Definition 1</strong>　Let \(E(u)\) be some vector over the Web pages that corresponds to a source of rank.
Then, the PageRank of a set of Web pages is an assignment, \(R^\prime\), to the Web pages which satisfies

\[
R^\prime(u)=c\sum_{v\in B_u} \frac{R^\prime(v)}{N_v}+cR(u)  \tag{1}
\]

　such that \(c\) is maximized and \(||R^\prime||_1 =1\)(\(||R^\prime||_1\) denotes the \(L_1\) norm of \(R^\prime\)).

</p>
<center><img src="images/fig3.png"></center>
<p>

﻿<center>Figure 3: Simplified PageRank Calculation</center>

</p><p>



　where \(E(u)\) is some vector over the web pages that corresponds to a source of rank (see Sec-
tion 6). Note that if \(E\) is all positive, \(c\) must be reduced to balance the equation. Therefore, this
technique corresponds to a decay factor. In matrix notation we have \(R^\prime = c(AR^\prime + E)\). Since
\(||R^\prime||_1 = 1\), we can rewrite this as \(R^\prime = c(A +E \times \mathbf{1})R^\prime\) where \(\mathbf{1}\) is the vector consisting of all ones.
So, \(R^\prime\) is an eigenvector of \((A+ E \times \mathbf{1})\).
</p>

<h3>2.5 Random Surfer Model</h3>
<p>

The definition of PageRank above has another intuitive basis in random walks on graphs. The
simplified version corresponds to the standing probability distribution of a random walk on the
graph of the Web. Intuitively, this can be thought of as modeling the behavior of a “random
surfer”. The “random surfer” simply keeps clicking on successive links at random. However, if a
real Web surfer ever gets into a small loop of web pages, it is unlikely that the surfer will continue
in the loop forever. Instead, the surfer will jump to some other page. The additional factor EF can
be viewed as a way of modeling this behavior: the surfer periodically “gets bored” and jumps to a
﻿random page chosen based on the distribution in \(E\).
</p><p>

　So far we have left & as a user defined parameter. In most tests we let / be uniform over all
web pages with value a. However, in Section 6 we show how different values of & can generate
“customized” page ranks.
</p>


<h3>2.6 Computing PageRank</h3>
<p>

The computation of PageRank is fairly straightforward if we ignore the issues of scale. Let \(S\) be
almost any vector over Web pages (for example \(E\)). Then PageRank may be computed as follows:

\[
\begin{align}
R_0 &\leftarrow S \\
\\
loop: & \\
\\
R_{i+1} &\leftarrow AR_i \\
\\
d &\leftarrow ||R_i||_1 — ||R_{i+1}||_1 \\
\\
R_{i+1} &\leftarrow R_{i+1}+dE \\
\\
\delta &\leftarrow ||R_{i+1}-R_i||_1 \\
\\
while\; \delta \gt \epsilon &
\end{align}
\]


　Note that the d factor increases the rate of convergence and maintains \(||R||_1\). An alternative
normalization is to multiply R by the appropriate factor. The use of d may have a small impact
on the influence of \(E\).
</p>

<h3>2.7 Dangling Links</h3>
<p>

One issue with this model is dangling links. Dangling links are simply links that point to any page
with no outgoing links. They affect the model because it is not clear where their weight should
be distributed, and there are a large number of them. Often these dangling links are simply pages
that we have not downloaded yet, since it is hard to sample the entire web (in our 24 million pages
currently downloaded, we have 51 million URLs not downloaded yet, and hence dangling). Because
dangling links do not affect the ranking of any other page directly, we simply remove them from
the system until all the PageRanks are calculated. After all the PageRanks are calculated, they
can be added back in, without affecting things significantly. Notice the normalization of the other
links on the same page as a link which was removed will change slightly, but this should not have
a large effect.
</p>

<h2>3 Implementation</h2>
<p>

As part of the Stanford WebBase project [PB98], we have built a complete crawling and indexing
system with a current repository of 24 million web pages. Any web crawler needs to keep a database
of URLs so it can discover all the URLs on the web. To implement PageRank, the web crawler
simply needs to build an index of links as it crawls. While a simple task, it is non-trivial because
of the huge volumes involved. For example, to index our current 24 million page database in about
five days, we need to process about 50 web pages per second. Since there about about 11 links on
an average page (depending on what you count as a link) we need to process 550 links per second.
Also, our database of 24 million pages references over 75 million unique URLs which each link must
be compared against.
</p><p>

　﻿Much time has been spent making the system resilient in the face of many deeply and intricately
flawed web artifacts. There exist infinitely large sites, pages, and even URLs. A large fraction of
web pages have incorrect HTML, making parser design difficult. Messy heuristics are used to help
the crawling process. For example, we do not crawl URLs with /cgi-bin/ in them. Of course it
is impossible to get a correct sample of the ”entire web” since it is always changing. Sites are
sometimes down, and some people decide to not allow their sites to be indexed. Despite all this, we
believe we have a reasonable representation of the actual link structure of publicly accessible web.
</p>

<h3>3.1 PageRank Implementation</h3>
<p>

We convert each URL into a unique integer, and store each hyperlink in a database using the integer
IDs to identify pages. Details of our implementation are in [PB98]. In general, we have implemented
PageRank in the following manner. First we sort the link structure by Parent ID. Then dangling
links are removed from the link database for reasons discussed above (a few iterations removes the
vast majority of the dangling links). We need to make an initial assignment of the ranks. This
assignment can be made by one of several strategies. If it is going to iterate until convergence, in
general the initial values will not affect final values, just the rate of convergence. But we can speed
up convergence by choosing a good initial assignment. We believe that careful choice of the initial
assignment and a small finite number of iterations may result in excellent or improved performance.
</p><p>

　Memory is allocated for the weights for every page. Since we use single precision floating point
values at 4 bytes each, this amounts to 300 megabytes for our 75 million URLs. If insufficient
RAM is available to hold all the weights, multiple passes can be made (our implementation uses
half as much memory and two passes). The weights from the current time step are kept in memory,
and the previous weights are accessed linearly on disk. Also, all the access to the link database,
A, is linear because it is sorted. Therefore, A can be kept on disk as well. Although these data
structures are very large, linear disk access allows each iteration to be completed in about 6 minutes
on a typical workstation. After the weights have converged, we add the dangling links back in and
recompute the rankings. Note after adding the dangling links back in, we need to iterate as many
times as was required to remove the dangling links. Otherwise, some of the dangling links will have
a zero weight. This whole process takes about five hours in the current implementation. With less
strict convergence criteria, and more optimization, the calculation could be much faster. Or, more
efficient techniques for estimating eigenvectors could be used to improve performance. However, it
should be noted that the cost required to compute the PageRank is insignificant compared to the
cost required to build a full text index.
</p>

<h2>4 Convergence Properties</h2>
<p>

As can be seen from the graph in Figure 4 PageRank on a large 322 million link database converges
to a reasonable tolerance in roughly 52 iterations. The convergence on half the data takes roughly
45 iterations. This graph suggests that PageRank will scale very well even for extremely large
collections as the scaling factor is roughly linear in log n.
</p>
<center><img src="images/fig2.png"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 4: Loop Which Acts as a Rank Sink</center>

</p><p>

　One of the interesting ramifications of the fact that the PageRank calculation converges rapidly
is that the web is an expander-like graph. To understand this better, we give a brief overview of
the theory of random walks on graphs; refer to Motwani-Raghavan [MR95] for further details. A
random walk on a graph is a stochastic process where at any given time step we are at a particular
node of the graph and choose an outedge uniformly at random to determine the node to visit at
the next time step. A graph is said to be an expander if it is the case that every (not too large)
subset of nodes S has a neighborhood (set of vertices accessible via outedges emanating from nodes
﻿in S) that is larger than some factor a times ||; here, a is called the expansion factor. It is the
case that a graph has a good expansion factor if and only if the largest eigenvalue is sufficiently
larger than the second-largest eigenvalue. A random walk on a graph is said to be rapidly-mixing
if it quickly (time logarithmic in the size of the graph) converges to a limiting distribution on the
set of nodes in the graph. It is also the case that a random walk is rapidly-mixing on a graph if
and only if the graph is an expander or has an eigenvalue separation.
</p><p>

　To relate all this to the PageRank computation, note that it is essentially the determination of
the limiting distribution of a random walk on the Web graph. The importance ranking of a node
is essentially the limiting probability that the random walk will be at that node after a sufficiently
large time. The fact that the PageRank computation terminates in logarithmic time is equivalent to
saying that the random walk is rapidly mixing or that the underlying graph has a good expansion
factor. Expander graphs have many desirable properties that we may be able to exploit in the
future in computations involving the Web graph.

<h2>5 Searching with PageRank</h2>
<p>

A major application of PageRank is searching. We have implemented two search engines which use
PageRank. The first one we will discuss is a simple title-based search engine. The second search
engine is a full text search engine called Google [BP]. Google utilizes a number of factors to rank
search results including standard IR measures, proximity, anchor text (text of links pointing to web
pages), and PageRank. While a comprehensive user study of the benefits of PageRank is beyond
the scope of this paper, we have performed some comparative experiments and provide some sample
results in this paper.
</p><p>

　﻿The benefits of PageRank are the greatest for underspecified queries. For example, a query
for “Stanford University” may return any number of web pages which mention Stanford (such as
publication lists) on a conventional search engine, but using PageRank, the university home page
is listed first.
</p>

<h3>5.1 Title Search</h3>
<p>

To test the usefulness of PageRank for search we implemented a search engine that used only the
titles of 16 million web pages. ‘To answer a query, the search engine finds all the web pages whose
titles contain all of the query words. Then it sorts the results by PageRank. This search engine
is very simple and cheap to implement. In informal tests, it worked remarkably well. As can be
seen in Figure 6, a search for “University” yields a list of top universities. This figure shows our
MultiQuery system which allows a user to query two search engines at the same time. The search
engine on the left is our PageRank based title search engine. The bar graphs and percentages shown
are a log of the actual PageRank with the top page normalized to 100%, not a percentile which is
used everywhere else in this paper. The search engine on the right is Altavista. You can see that
Altavista returns random looking web pages that match the query “University” and are the root
page of the server (Altavista seems to be using URL length as a quality heuristic).

<center>Figure 6: Comparison of Query for “University”</center>
</p>




<h3>5.2 Rank Merging</h3>
<p>

The reason that the title based PageRank system works so well is that the title match ensures
high precision, and the PageRank ensures high quality. When matching a query like “University”
on the web, recall is not very important because there is far more than a user can look at. For
more specific searches where recall is more important, the traditional information retrieval scores
over full-text and the PageRank should be combined. Our Google system does this type of rank
merging. Rank merging is known to be a very difficult problem, and we need to spend considerable
additional effort before we will be able to do a reasonable evaluation of these types of queries.
However, we do believe that using PageRank as a factor in these queries is quite beneficial.
</p>

<h3>5.3 Some Sample Results</h3>
<p>

We have experimented considerably with Google, a full-text search engine which uses PageRank.
While a full-scale user study is beyond the scope of this paper, we provide a sample query in
Appendix A. For more queries, we encourage the reader to test Google themselves [BP].
</p><p>

　Table 1 shows the top 15 pages based on PageRank. This particular listing was generated in
July 1996. In a more recent calculation of PageRank, Microsoft has just edged out Netscape for
the highest PageRank.

<h3>5.4 Common Case</h3>
<p>

One of the design goals of PageRank was to handle the common case for queries well. For example,
a user searched for “wolverine”, remembering that the University of Michigan system used for all
administrative functions by students was called something with a wolverine in it. Our PageRank
based title search system returned the answer “Wolverine Access” as the first result. This is sensible
since all the students regularly use the Wolverine Access system, and a random user is quite likely
to be looking for it given the query “wolverine”. The fact that the Wolverine Access site is a good
common case is not contained in the HTML of the page. Even if there were a way of defining good
﻿meta-information of this form within a page, it would be problematic since a page author could
not be trusted with this kind of evaluation. Many web page authors would simply claim that their
pages were all the best and most used on the web.
</p><p>

　It is important to note that the goal of finding a site that contains a great deal of information
about wolverines is a very different task than finding the common case wolverine site. There is an
interesting system |[Mar97| that attempts to find sites that discuss a topic in detail by propagating
the textual matching score through the link structure of the web. It then tries to return the page
on the most central path. This results in good results for queries like “flower”; the system will
return good navigation pages from sites that deal with the topic of flowers in detail. Contrast that
with the common case approach which might simply return a commonly used commercial site that
had little information except how to buy flowers. It is our opinion that both of these tasks are
important, and a general purpose web search engine should return results which fulfill the needs
of both of these tasks automatically. In this paper, we are concentrating only on the common case
approach.
</p>

<h3>5.5 Subcomponents of Common Case</h3>
<p>

It is instructive to consider what kind of common case scenarios PageRank can help represent.
Besides a page which has a high usage, like the Wolverine Access cite, PageRank can also represent
a collaborative notion of authority or trust. For example, a user might prefer a news story simply
because it is linked is linked directly from the New York Times home page. Of course such a story
will receive quite a high PageRank simply because it is mentioned by a very important page. This
seems to capture a kind of collaborative trust, since if a page was mentioned by a trustworthy
or authoritative source, it is more likely to be trustworthy or authoritative. Similarly, quality or
importance seems to fit within this kind of circular definition.
</p>

<h2>6 Personalized PageRank</h2>
<p>

An important component of the PageRank calculation is & — a vector over the Web pages which
is used as a source of rank to make up for the rank sinks such as cycles with no outedges (see
Section 2.4). However, aside from solving the problem of rank sinks, F turns out to be a powerful
parameter to adjust the page ranks. Intuitively the & vector corresponds to the distribution of web
pages that a random surfer periodically jumps to. As we see below, it can be used to give broad
general views of the Web or views which are focussed and personalized to a particular individual.
</p><p>

　We have performed most experiments with an / vector that is uniform over all web pages with
\(||E||_1 = 0.15\). This corresponds to a random surfer periodically jumping to a random web page.
This is a very democratic choice for EF since all web pages are valued simply because they exist.
Although this technique has been quite successful, there is an important problem with it. Some
Web pages with many related links receive an overly high ranking. Examples of these include
copyright warnings, disclaimers, and highly interlinked mailing list archives.
</p><p>

　Another extreme is to have \(E\) consist entirely of a single web page. We tested two such \(E\)’s —
the Netscape home page, and the home page of a famous computer scientist, John McCarthy. For
the Netscape home page, we attempt to generate page ranks from the perspective of a novice user
who has Netscape set as the default home page. In the case of John McCarthy’s home page we
want to calculate page ranks from the perspective of an individual who has given us considerable
contextual information based on the links on his home page.
</p><p>

　In both cases, the mailing list problem mentioned above did not occur. And, in both cases, the
respective home page got the highest PageRank and was followed by its immediate links. From




that point, the disparity decreased. In Table 2, we show the resulting page rank percentiles for
an assortment of different pages. Pages related to computer science have a higher McCarthy-rank
than Netscape-rank and pages related to computer science at Stanford have a considerably higher
McCarthy-rank. For example, the Web page of another Stanford Computer Science Dept. faculty
member is more than six percentile points higher on the McCarthy-rank. Note that the page ranks
are displayed as percentiles. This has the effect of compressing large differences in PageRank at
the top of the range.
</p>

<p>

Table 2: Page Ranks for Two Different Views: Netscape vs. John McCarthy
</p><p>

　Such personalized page ranks may have a number of applications, including personal search
engines. These search engines could save users a great deal of trouble by efficiently guessing a
large part of their interests given simple input such as their bookmarks or home page. We show an
example of this in Appendix A with the “Mitchell” query. In this example, we demonstrate that
while there are many people on the web named Mitchell, the number one result is the home page
of a colleague of John McCarthy named John Mitchell.
</p>

<h3>6.1 Manipulation by Commercial Interests</h3>
<p>

These types of personalized PageRanks are virtually immune to manipulation by commercial in-
terests. For a page to get a high PageRank, it must convince an important page, or a lot of
non-important pages to link to it. At worst, you can have manipulation in the form of buying
advertisements(links) on important sites. But, this seems well under control since it costs money.
This immunity to manipulation is an extremely important property. This kind of commercial ma-
nipulation is causing search engines a great deal of trouble, and making features that would be great
to have very difficult to implement. For example fast updating of documents is a very desirable
feature, but it is abused by people who want to manipulate the results of the search engine.
</p><P>

　A compromise between the two extremes of uniform FE and single page F is to let & consist of
all the root level pages of all web servers. Notice this will allow some manipulation of PageRanks.
Someone who wished to manipulate this system could simply create a large number of root level
servers all pointing at a particular site.
</p>

﻿<h2>7 Applications</h2>
<h3>7.1 Estimating Web Traffic</h3>
<p>

Because PageRank roughly corresponds to a random web surfer (see Section 2.5), it is interesting
to see how PageRank corresponds to actual usage. We used the counts of web page accesses from
NLANR [NLA] proxy cache and compared these to PageRank. The NLANR data was from several
national proxy caches over the period of several months and consisted of 11,817,665 unique URLs
with the highest hit count going to Altavista with 638,657 hits. There were 2.6 million pages in the
intersection of the cache data and our 75 million URL database. It is extremely difficult to compare
these datasets analytically for a number of different reasons. Many of the URLs in the cache access
data are people reading their personal mail on free email services. Duplicate server names and page
names are a serious problem. Incompleteness and bias a problem is both the PageRank data and
the usage data. However, we did see some interesting trends in the data. There seems to be a high
usage of pornographic sites in the cache data, but these sites generally had low PageRanks. We
believe this is because people do not want to link to pornographic sites from their own web pages.
Using this technique of looking for differences between PageRank and usage, it may be possible to
find things that people like to look at, but do not want to mention on their web pages. There are
some sites that have a very high usage, but low PageRank such as netscape.yahoo.com. We believe
there is probably an important backlink which simply is omitted from our database (we only have
a partial link structure of the web). It may be possible to use usage data as a start vector for
PageRank, and then iterate PageRank a few times. This might allow filling in holes in the usage
data. In any case, these types of comparisons are an interesting topic for future study.
</p>

<h3>7.2 PageRank as Backlink Predictor</h3>
<p>

One justification for PageRank is that it is a predictor for backlinks. In [|CGMP98] we explore the
issue of how to crawl the web efficiently, trying to crawl better documents first. We found on tests
of the Stanford web that PageRank is a better predictor of future citation counts than citation
counts themselves.
</p><p>

　The experiment assumes that the system starts out with only a single URL and no other
information, and the goal is to try to crawl the pages in as close to the optimal order as possible.
The optimal order is to crawl pages in exactly the order of their rank according to an evaluation
function. For the purposes here, the evaluation function is simply the number of citations, given
complete information. The catch is that all the information to calculate the evaluation function is
not available until after all the documents have been crawled. It turns out using the incomplete
data, PageRank is a more effective way to order the crawling than the number of known citations.
In other words, PageRank is a better predictor than citation counting even when the measure is
the number of citations! The explanation for this seems to be that PageRank avoids the local
maxima that citation counting gets stuck in. For example, citation counting tends to get stuck in
local collections like the Stanford CS web pages, taking a long time to branch out and find highly
cited pages in other areas. PageRank quickly finds the Stanford homepage is important, and gives
preference to its children resulting in an efficient, broad search.
</p><p>

　This ability of PageRank to predict citation counts is a powerful justification for using PageR-
ank. Since it is very difficult to map the citation structure of the web completely, PageRank may
even be a better citation count approximation than citation counts themselves.
</p>


<h3>7.3 User Navigation: The PageRank Proxy</h3>
<p>

We have developed a web proxy application that annotates each link that a user sees with its
PageRank. This is quite useful, because users receive some information about the link before they
click on it. In Figure 7 is a screen shot from the proxy. The length of the red bars is the log of the
URL’s PageRank. We can see that major organizations, like Stanford University, receive a very
high ranking followed by research groups, and then people, with professors at the high end of the
people scale. Also notice ACM has a very high PageRank, but not as high as Stanford University.
Interestingly, this PageRank annotated view of the page makes an incorrect URL for one of the
professors glaringly obvious since the professor has a embarrassingly low PageRank. Consequently
this tool seems useful for authoring pages as well as navigation. This proxy is very helpful for
looking at the results from other search engines, and pages with large numbers of links such as
Yahoo’s listings. The proxy can help users decide which links in a long listing are more likely to
be interesting. Or, if the user has some idea where the link they are looking for should fall in the
“importance” spectrum, they should be able to scan for it much more quickly using the proxy.

<h3>﻿7.4 Other Uses of PageRank</h3>
<p>


The original goal of PageRank was a way to sort backlinks so if there were a large number of
backlinks for a document, the “best” backlinks could be displayed first. We have implemented such
a system. It turns out this view of the backlinks ordered by PageRank can be very interesting when
trying to understand your competition. For example, the people who run a news site always want
to keep track of any significant backlinks the competition has managed to get. Also, PageRank can
help the user decide if a site is trustworthy or not. For example, a user might be inclined to trust
information that is directly cited from the Stanford homepage.
</p>

<h2>8 Conclusion</h2>
<p>

In this paper, we have taken on the audacious task of condensing every page on the World Wide
Web into a single number, its PageRank. PageRank is a global ranking of all web pages, regardless
of their content, based solely on their location in the Web’s graph structure.
</p><p>

　Using PageRank, we are able to order search results so that more important and central Web
pages are given preference. In experiments, this turns out to provide higher quality search results to
users. Th intuition behind PageRank is that it uses information which is exernal to the Web pages
themselves - their backlinks, which provide a kind of peer review. Furthermore, backlinks from
“important” pages are more significant than backlinks from average pages. This is encompassed in
the recursive definition of PageRank (Section 2.4).
</p><p>

　PageRank could be used to separate out a small set of commonly used documents which can
answer most queries. The full database only needs to be consulted when the small database is not
adequate to answer a query. Finally, PageRank may be a good way to help find representative
pages to display for a cluster center.
</p><p>

　We have found a number of applications for PageRank in addition to search which include traffic
estimation, and user navigation. Also, we can generate personalized PageRanks which can create
a view of Web from a particular perspective.
</p><p>

 Overall, our experiments with PageRank suggest that the structure of the Web graph is very
useful for a variety of information retrieval tasks.
