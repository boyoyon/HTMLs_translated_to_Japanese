Abstract. The time required to recognize that two perspective drawings portray 
objects of the same three-dimensional shape is found to be (i) a linearly increasing 
function of the angular difference in the portrayed orientations of the two objects 
and (ii) no shorter for differences corresponding simply to a rigid rotation of one 
of the two-dimensional drawings in its own picture plane than for differences 
corresponding to, a rotation of the three-dimensional object in depth. 
</p><p>

Human subjects are often able to 
determine that two two-dimensional 
pictures portray objects of the same 
three-dimensional shape even though 
the objects .are depicted in very different 
orientations. The experiment reported 
here was designed to measure the time 
that subjects require to determine such 
identity of shape as a function of the 
angular difference in the portrayed ori- 
entations of the two three-dimensional 
objects.
</p><p>
 
This angular difference was produced 
either by a rigid rotation of one of two 
identical pictures in its own picture 
plane or by a much more complex, 
nonrigid transformation, of one of the 
pictures, that corresponds to a (rigid) 
rotation of the three-dimensional ob- 
ject in depth. 
</p><p>

This reaction time is found (i) to 
increase linearly with the angular dif- 
ference in portrayed orientation and 
(ii) to be no longer for a rotation in 
depth than for a rotation merely in the 
picture plane. These findings appear to 
place rather severe constraints on pos- 
sible explanations of how subjects go 
about determining identity of shape of 
differently oriented objects. They are, 
however, consistent with an explanation 
suggested by the subjects themselves. 
Although introspective reports must be 
interpreted with caution, all subjects 
claimed (i) that to make the required 
comparison they first had to imagine 
one object as rotated into the same 
orientation as the other and that they 
could carry out this "mental rotation" 
at no greater than a certain limiting 
rate; and (ii) that, since they perceived 
the two-dimensional pictures as objects 
in three-dimensional space, they could 
imagine the rotation around whichever 
axis was required with equal ease. 
</p><p>

In the experiment each of eight adult 
subjects was presented with 1600 pairs 
of perspective line drawings. For each 
pair the subject was asked to pull a 
right-hand lever as soon as he deter- 
mined that the two drawings portrayed 
objects that were congruent with respect 
to three-dimensional shape and to pull 
a left-hand lever as soon as he deter- 
mined that the two drawings depicted 
objects of different three-dimensional 
shapes. According to a random se- 
quence, in half of the pairs (the "same" 
pairs) the two objects could be rotated 
into congruence with each other (as in 
Fig. 1, A and B), and in the other half 
(the "different" pairs) the two objects 
differed by a reflection as well as a 
rotation and could not be rotated into 
congruence (as in Fig. 1C).

Fig. 1. Examples of pairs of perspective 
line drawings presented to the subjects. 
(A) A "same" pair, which differs by an 
\(80^\circ\) rotation in the picture plane; (B) a 
"same" pair, which differs by an \(80^\circ\) ro- 
tation in depth; and (C ) a "different" 
pair, which cannot be brought into con- 
gruence by any rotation. 
</p><p>

The choice of objects that were mir- 
ror images or "isomers" of each other 
for the "different" pairs was intended 
to prevent subjects from discovering 
some distinctive feature possessed by 
only one of the two objects and thereby 
reaching a decision of noncongruence 
without actually having to carry out 
any mental rotation. As a further pre- 
caution, the ten different three-dimen- 
sional objects depicted in the various 
perspective drawings were chosen to 
be relatively unfamiliar and meaning- 
less in overall three-dimensional shape. 
</p><p>

Each object consisted of ten solid 
cubes attached face-to-face to form a 
rigid armlike structure with exactly 
three right-angled "elbows" (see Fig. 1). 
The set of all ten shapes included two 
subsets of five: within either subset, no 
shape could be transformed into itself 
or any other by any reflection or rota- 
tion (short of \(360^\circ\)). However, each 
shape in either subset was the mirror 
image of one shape in the other sub- 
set, as required for the construction of 
the "different" pairs. 
</p><p>

For each of the ten objects, 18 dif- 
ferent perspective projections-corre- 
sponding to one complete turn around 
the vertical axis by \(20^\circ\) steps-were 
generated by digital computer and asso- 
ciated graphical output (1). Seven of the 
18 perspective views of each object 
were then selected so as (i) to avoid any 
views in which some part of the object 
was wholly occluded by another part 
and yet (ii) to permit the construction 
of two pairs that differed in orientation 
by each possible angle, in \(20^\circ\) steps, 
from \(0^\circ\) to \(180^\circ\). These 70 line draw- 
ings were then reproduced by photo- 
offset process and were attached to 
cards in pairs for presentation to the 
subjects. 
</p><p>

Half of the "same" pairs (the "depth" 
pairs) represented two objects that dif- 
fered by some multiple of a 200 rota- 
tion about a vertical axis (Fig. iB). For 
each of these pairs, copies of two appro- 
priately different perspective views were 
simply attached to the cards in the 
orientation in which they were origi- 
nally generated. The other half of the 
"same" pairs (the "picture-plane" pairs) 
represented two objects that differed by 
some multiple of a \(20^\circ\) rotation in the 
plane of the drawings themselves (Fig. 
1A). For each of these, one of the 
seven perspective views was selected 
for each object and two copies of this 
picture were attached to the card in 
appropriately different orientations. Al- 
together, the 1600 pairs presented to 
each subject included 800 "same" pairs, 
which consisted of 400 unique pairs (20 
"depth" and 20 "picture-plane" pairs 
at each of the ten angular differences 
from \(0^\circ\) to \(180^\circ\)), each of which was 
presented twice. The remaining 800 
pairs, randomly intermixed with these, 
consisted of 400 unique "different" 
pairs, each of which (again) was pre- 
sented twice. Each of these "different" 
pairs corresponded to one "same" pair 
(of either the "depth" or "picture-plane" 
variety) in which, however, one of the 
three-dimensional objects had been re- 
flected about some plane in three-di- 
mensional space. Thus the two objects 
in each "different" pair differed, in gen- 
eral, by both .a reflection and a rota- 
tion. 
</p><p>

The 1600 pairs were grouped into 
blocks of not more than 200 and pre- 
sented over eight to ten 1-hour ses- 
sions (depending upon the subject). 
Also, although it is only of incidental 
interest here, each such block of pres- 
entations was either "pure," in that all 
pairs involved rotations of the same 
type ("depth" or "picture-plane"), or 
"mixed," in that the two types of rotation were randomly intermixed within 
the same block. 
</p><p>
Each trial began with a warning tone, 
which was followed half a second later 
by the presentation of a stimulus pair 
and the simultaneous onset of a timer. 
The lever-pulling response stopped the 
timer, recorded the subject's reaction 
time and terminated the visual display. 
The line drawings, which averaged be- 
tween 4 and 5 cm In maximum linear 
extent, appeared at a viewing distance 
of about 60 cm. They were positioned, 
with a center-to-center spacing that 
subtended a visual angle of \(9^\circ\), in two 
circular apertures in a vertical black 
surface (see Fig. 1, A to C). 
</p><p>

The subjects were instructed to re- 
spond as quickly as possible while keep- 
ing errors to a minimum. On the aver- 
age only 3.2 percent of the responses 
were incorrect (ranging from 0.6 to 
5.7 percent for individual subjects). The 
reaction-time data presented below in- 
clude only the 96.8 percent correct re- 
sponses. However, the data for the in- 
correct responses exhibit a similar pat- 
tern. 
</p><p>

In Fig. 2, the overall means of the 
reaction times as a function of angular 
difference in orientation for all correct 
(right-hand) responses to "same" pairs 
are plotted separately for the pairs dif- 
fering by a rotation in the picture plane 
(Fig. 2A) and for the pairs differing by 
a rotation in depth (Fig. 2B). In both 
cases, reaction time is a strikingly linear 
function of the angular difference be- 
tween the two three-dimensional objects 
portrayed. The mean reaction times for 
individual subjects increased from a 
value of about 1 second at \(0^\circ\) of rota- 
tion for all subjects to values ranging 
from 4 to 6 seconds at \(180^\circ\) of rotation, 
depending upon the particular individ- 
ual. Moreover, despite such variations 
in slope, the linearity of the function is 
clearly evident when the data are 
plotted separately for individual three- 
dimensional objects or for individual 
subjects. Polynomial regression lines 
were computed separately for each sub- 
ject under each type of rotation. In 
all 16 cases the functions were found to 
have a highly significant linear com- 
ponent (P <.001) when tested against 
deviations from linearity. No significant 
quadratic or higher-order effects were 
found (P > .05, in all cases).

Fig. 2..Mean reaction times to two perspec- 
tive line drawings portraying objects of the 
same three-dimensional shape. Times are 
plotted as a function of angular difference 
in portrayed orientation: (A ) for pairs 
differing by a rotation in the picture 
plane only; and (B) for pairs differing 
by a. rotation in depth. (The centers of 
the circles indicate the means and. when 

they extend far enough to show outside
these circles, the vertical bars around each circle
indicate a conservative estimate of the standard error of that mean
based on the distribution of the eight component 
means contributed by the individual subjects.)


</p><p>
The angle through which different 
three-dimensional shapes must be ro- 
tated to achieve congruence is not, of 
course, defined. Therefore, a function 
like those plotted in Fig. 2 cannot be 
constructed in any straightforward manner for the "different" pairs. The overall 
mean reaction time for these pairs was 
found, however, to be 3.8 seconds- 
nearly a second longer than the cor- 
responding overall means for the "same" 
pairs. (In the postexperimental inter- 
view, the subjects typically reported 
that they attempted to rotate one end of 
one object into congruence with the 
corresponding end of the other object; 
they discovered that the two objects 
were different when, after this "rota- 
tion," the two free ends still remained 
noncongruent.) 
</p><p>

Not only are the two functions shown 
in Fig. 2 both linear but they are very 
similar to each other with respect to 
intercept and slope. Indeed, for the 
larger angular differences the reaction 
times were, if anything, somewhat 
shorter for rotation in depth than for 
rotation in the picture plane. However, 
since this small difference is either ab- 
sent or reversed in four of the eight 
subjects, it is of doubtful significance. 
The determination of identity of shape 
may therefore be based, in both cases, 
upon a process of the same general 
kind. If we can describe this process as 
some sort of "mental rotation in three- 
dimensional space," then the slope of 
the obtained functions indicates that 
the average rate at which these particu- 
lar objects can be thus "rotated" is 
roughly \(60^\circ\) per second. 
</p><p>

Of course the plotted reaction times 
necessarily include any times taken by 
the subjects to decide how to process 
the pictures in each presented pair as 
well as the time taken actually to carry 
out the process, once it was chosen. 
However, even for these highly prac- 
ticed subjects, the reaction times were 
still linear and were no more than 20 
percent lower in the "pure" blocks of 
presentations (in which the subjects 
knew both the axis and the direction 
of the required rotation in advance of 
each presentation) than in the "mixed" 
blocks (in which the axis of rotation 
was unpredictable). Tentatively, this 
suggests that 80 percent of a typical 
one of these reaction times may rep- 
resent some such process as "mental 
rotation" itself, rather than a prelimi- 
nary process of preparation or search. 
Nevertheless, in further research now 
underway, we are seeking clarification 
of this point and others.
