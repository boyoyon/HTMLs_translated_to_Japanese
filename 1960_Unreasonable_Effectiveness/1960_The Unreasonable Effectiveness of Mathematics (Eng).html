<p>
There is a story about two friends, who were classmates in high school, 
talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was working 
on population trends. He showed a reprint to his former classmate, The 
reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution and the statistician 
explained to his former classmate the meaning of the symbols for the actual 
population, for the average population, and so on. His classmate was a 
bit incredulous and was not quite sure whether the statistician was pulling 
his leg. “How can you know that?” was his query. “And what is this 
symbol iere?” “Oh,” said the statistician, “this is n.” “What is that?” 
“The ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter.” “Well, now 
you are pushing your joke too far,” said the classmate, “surely the pop- 
ulation has nothing to do with the circumference of the circle.” 
</p><p>
Naturally, we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the classmate’s 
approach. Nevertheless, when I heard this story, I had to admit to an 
eerie feeling because, surely, the reaction of the classmate betrayed only 
plain common sense. I was even more confused when, not many days later, 
someone came to me and expressed his bewilderment1 with the fact that 
we make a rather narrow selection when choosing the data on which we 
test our theories. “How do we know that, if we made a theory which focusses 
its attention on phenomena we disregard and disregards some of the phe- 
nomena now commanding our attention, that we could not build another 
theory which has little in common with the present one but which, never-
theless, explains just as many phenomena as the present theory.” It has 
to be admitted that we have not definite evidence that there is no such theory. 
</p>
<p class="margin-large">
<sup>1</sup> The remark to be quoted was made by F. Werner when he was a student in Princeton. 
</p>
<p>
The preceding two stories illustrate the two main points which are the 
subjects of the present discourse. The first point is that mathematical con-
concepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections. Moreover, they often 
permit an unexpectedly close and accurate description of the phenomena in 
these connections. Secondly, just because of this circumstance, and because 
we do not understand the reasons of their usefulness, we cannot know 
whether a theory formulated in terms of mathematical concepts is uniquely 
appropriate. We are in a position similar to that of a man who was provided 
with a bunch of keys and who, having to open several doors in succession, 
always hit on the right key on the first or second trial. He became skeptical 
concerning the uniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors. 
</p><p>
Most of what will be said on these questions will not be new; it has 
probably occurred to most scientists in one form or another. My principal 
aim is to illuminate it from several sides. The first point is that the enormous 
usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on 
the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it. Second, it is 
just this uncanny usefulness of mathematical concepts that raises the ques- 
tion of the uniqueness of our physical theories In order to establish the first 
point, that mathematics plays an unreasonably important role in physics, 
it will be useful to say a few words on the question “What is mathematics?”, 
then, “What is physics?”, then, how mathematics enters physical theories, 
and last, why the success of mathematics in its role in physics appears so 
baffling. Much less will be said on the second point: the uniqueness of the 
theories of physics. A proper answer to this question would require elaborate 
experimental and theoretical work which has not been undertaken to date. 
</p><p>
What is Mathematics? Somebody once said that philosophy is the 
misuse of a terminology which was invented just for this purpose.<sup>2</sup> In the 
same vein, I would say that mathematics is the science of skillful operations 
with concepts and rules invented just for this purpose. The principal 
emphasis is on the invention of concepts. Mathematics would soon run out 
of interesting theorems if these had to be formulated in terms of the concepts 
which already appear in the axioms. Furthermore, whereas it is unquestion- 
ably true that the concepts of elementary mathematics and particularly 
elementary geometry were formulated to describe entities which are directly 
suggested by the actual world, the same does not seem to be true of the more 
advanced concepts, in particular the concepts which play such an important 
role in physics. Thus, the rules for operations with pairs of numbers are 
obviously designed to give the same results as the operations with fractions 
which we first learned without reference to “pairs of numbers”. The rules 
for the operations with sequences, that is with irrational numbers, still 
belong to the category of rules which were determined so as to reproduce 
rules for the operations with quantities which were already known to us. 
Most more advanced mathematical concepts, such as complex numbers, 
algebras, linear operators, Bore1 sets- and this list could be continued almost 
indefinitely-were so devised that they are apt subjects on which the 
mathematician can demonstrate his ingenuity and sense of formal beauty. 
In fact, the definition of these concepts, with a realization that interesting 
and ingenious considerations could be applied to them, is the first demon- 
stration of the ingeniousness of the mathematician who defines them. 
The depth of thought which goes into the formation of the mathematical 
concepts is later justified by the skill with which these concepts are used. 
The great mathematician fully, almost ruthlessly, exploits the domain of 
permissible reasoning and skirts the impermissible. That his recklessness 
does not lead him into a morass of contradictions is a miracle in itself: 
certainly it is hard to believe that our reasoning power was brought, by 
Darwin’s process of natural selection, to the perfection which it seems to 
possess. However, this is not our present subject. The principal point which 
will have to be recalled later is that the mathematician could formulate only 
a handful of interesting theorems without defining concepts beyond those 
contained in the axioms and that the concepts outside those contained in 
the axioms are defined with a view of permitting ingenious logical opera- 
tions which appeal to our aesthetic sense both as operations and also in 
their results of great generality and simplicity.<sup>3</sup> 
</p>
<p class="margin-large">
<sup>2</sup> This statement is quoted here from W. Dubislav’s Die Philosophie der Mathematik in dev Gegenwavi. Junker und Dunnhaupt Verlag, Berlin, 1932, p. 1. <br>
<sup>3</sup>　M.Polanyi, in his Personal Ktzowledge, University of Chicago Press, 1958 says: 
“All these difficulties are but consequences of our refusal to see that mathematics cannot be 
defined without acknowledging its most obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting,” 
(page 188). 
</p><p>

The complex numbers provide a particularly striking example for the 
foregoing. Certainly, nothing in our experience suggests the introduction of 
these quantities. Indeed, if a mathematician is asked to justify his interest 
in complex numbers, he will point, with some indignation, to the many 
beautiful theorems in the theory of equations, of power series and of analytic 
functions in general, which owe their origin to the introduction of complex 
numbers. The mathematician is not willing to give up his interest in these 
most beautiful accomplishments of his genius.<sup>4</sup>

<p class="margin-large">
<sup>4</sup>　The reader may be interested, in this connection, in Hilbert’s rather testy remarks 
about intuitionism which “seeks to break up and to disfigure mathematics”, Abh. Math. Sem. 
Univ. Hamburg, Vol. 157, 1922, or Gesammelte Werke, Springer, Berlin, 1935, page 188. 
</p><p>
Whatis Physics? The physicist is interested in discovering the laws of 
inanimate nature. In order to understand this statement, it is necessary 
to analyze the concept “law of nature”. 
</p><p>
The world around us is of baffling complexity and the most obvious 
fact about it is that we cannot predict the future. Although the joke 
attributes only to the optimist the view that the future is uncertain, the 
optimist is right in this case: the future is unpredictable. It is, as Schro-
dinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling complexity of 
the world, certain regularities in the events could be discovered [l]. One 
such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that two rocks, dropped at the same 
time from the same height, reach the ground at the same time. The laws 
of nature are concerned with such regularities. Galileo’s regularity is a 
prototype of a large class of regularities. It is a surprising regularity for 
three reasons. 
</p><p>
The first reason that it is surprising is that it is true not only in Pisa, 
and in Galileo’s time, it is true everywhere on the Earth, was always true, 
and will always be true. This property of the regularity is a recognized 
invariance property and, as I had occasion to point out some time ago [2], 
without invariance principles similar to those implied in the preceding 
generalization of Galileo’s observation, physics would not be possible. 
The second surprising feature is that the regularity which we are discussing 
is independent of so many conditions which could have an effect on it. 
It is valid no matter whether it rains or not, whether the experiment is 
carried out in a room or from the Leaning Tower, no matter whether the 
person who drops the rocks is a man or a woman. It is valid even if the 
two rocks are dropped, simultaneously and from the same height, by 
two different people. There are, obviously, innumerable other conditions 
which are all immaterial from the point of view of the validity of Galileo’s 
regularity. The irrelevancy of so many circumstances which could play a 
role in the phenomenon observed, has also been called an invariance [2]. 
However, this invariance is of a different character than the preceding one 
since it cannot be formulated as a general principle. The exploration of the 
conditions which do, and which do not, influence a phenomenon is part of 
the early experimental exploration of a field. It is the skill and ingenuity 
of the experimenter which shows him phenomena which depend on a rel-
atively narrow set of relatively easily realizable and reproducible con-
dition.<sup>5</sup> In the present case, Galileo’s restriction of his observations to 
relatively heavy bodies was the most important step in this regard. Again, 
it is true that if there were no phenomena which are independent of all but 
a manageably small set of conditions, physics would be impossible. 
</p>
<p class="margin-large">
<sup>5</sup>　See, in this connection, the graphic essay of &I.Deutsch, Daedalus, Vol. 87, 1958, 
page 86 A. Shimony has called my attention to a similar passage in C S. Peirce’s Essays zn 
the Phzlosophy of Sczence, The Liberal Arts Press, New York, 1957 (page 237). 

</p><p>
The preceding two points, though highly significant from the point of 
view of the philosopher, are not the ones which surprised GaIileo most, nor 
do they contain a specific law of nature. The law of nature is contained in 
the statement that the length of time which it takes for a heavy object to 
fall from a given height is independent of the size, material and shape of 
the body which drops. In the framework of Newton’s second “law”, this 
amounts to the statement that the gravitational force which acts on the 
falling body is proportional to its mass but independent of the size, material 
and shape of the body which falls. 
</p><p>
The preceding discussion is intended to remind, first, that it is not 
at all natural that “laws of nature” exist, much less that man is able to 
discover them.<sup>6</sup> The present writer had occasion, some time ago, to call 
attention to the succession of layers of “laws of nature”, each layer con-
taining more general and more encompassing laws than the previous one 
and its discovery constituting a deeper penetration into the structure of 
the universe than the layers recognized before [3]. However, the point 
which is most significant in the present context is that all these laws of 
nature contain, in even their remotest consequences, only a small part of 
our knowledge of the inanimate world. All the laws of nature are conditional 
statements which permit a prediction of some future events on the basis 
of the knowledge of the present, except that some aspects of the present 
state of the world, in practice the overwhelming majority of the determinants 
of the present state of the world, are irrelevant from the point of view of 
the prediction. The irrelevancy is meant in the sense of the second point 
in the discussion of Galileo’s theorem.<sup>7</sup> 
</p>
<p class="margin-large">
<sup>6</sup>　Schr&ouml;dinger, in his What is Lije, Cambridge University Press, 1915, says that this 
second miracle may well be beyond human understanding, (page 31). <br>
<sup>7</sup>　The writer feels sure that it is unnecessary to mention that Galileo’s theorem, as given 
in the text, does not exhaust the content of Galileo’sobservations in connection with the 
laws of freely falling bodies. 
</p><p>
As regards the present state of the world, such as the existence of the 
earth on which we live and on which Galileo’s experiments were performed, 
the existence of the sun and of all our surroundings, the laws of nature are 
entirely silent. It is in consonance with this, first, that the laws of nature 
can be used to predict future events only under exceptional circumstances 
-when all the relevant determinants of the present state of the world are 
known. It is also in consonance with this that the construction of machines, 
the functioning of which he can foresee, constitutes the most spectacular 
accomplishment of the physicist. In these machines, the physicist creates 
a situation in which all the relevant coordinates are known so that the be- 
havior of the machine can be predicted. Radars and nuclear reactors are 
examples of such machines. 







</p><p>
The principal purpose of the preceding discussion is to point out that 
the laws of nature are all conditional statements and they relate only to a 
very small part of our knowledge of the world. Thus, classical mechanics, 
which is the best known prototype of a physical theory, gives the second 
derivatives of the positional coordinates of all bodies, on the basis of the 
knowledge of the positions, etc., of these bodies. It gives no information on 
the existence, the present positions, or velocities of these bodies. It should 
be mentioned, for the sake of accuracy, that we have learned about thirty 
years ago that even the conditional statements cannot be entirely precise: 
that the conditional statements are probability laws which enable us only 
to place intelligent bets on future properties of the inanimate world, based 
on the knowledge of the present state. They do not allow us to make 
categorical statements, not even categorical statements conditional on the 
present state of the world. The probabilistic nature of the “laws of nature” 
manifests itself in the case of machines also, and can be verified, at least in 
the case of nuclear reactors, if one runs them at very low power. However, 
the additional limitation of the scope of the laws of nature <sup>8</sup> which follows 
from their probabilistic nature, will play no role in the rest of the discussion.

</p><p>
The Role of Mathematics in Physical Theories. Having refreshed our 
minds as to the essence of mathematics and physics, we should be in a 
better position to review the role of mathematics in physical theories. 
</p><p>
Naturally, we do use mathematics in everyday physics to evaluate the 
results of the laws of nature, to apply the conditional statements to the 
particular conditions which happen to prevail or happen to interest us. 
In order that this be possible, the laws of nature must already be formulated 
in mathematical language. However, the role of evaluating the conse-
quences of already established theories is not the most important role of math- 
ematics in physics. Mathematics, or, rather, applied mathematics, is not so 
much the master of the situation in this function: it is merely serving as a tool. 

Mathematics does play, however, also a more sovereign role in physics. 
This was already implied in the statement, made when discussing the role of 
applied mathematics, that the laws of nature must be already formulated 
in the language of mathematics to be an object for the use of applied math- 
ematics. The statement that the laws of nature are written in the language 
of mathematics was properly made three hundred years ago <sup>9</sup>; it is now more 
true than ever before. In order to show the importance which mathematical 
concepts possess in the formulation of the laws of physics, let us recall, as 
an example, the axioms of quantum mechanics as formulated, explicitly, 
by the great mathematician, von Neumann, or, implicitly, by the great 
physicist, Dirac [4, 51. There are two basic concepts in quantum mechanics: 
states and observables. The states are vectors in Hilbert space, the observ- 
ables self-adjoint operators on these vectors. The possible values of the 
observations are the characteristic values of the operators-but we had 
better stop here lest we engage in a listing of the mathematical concepts 
developed in the theory of linear operators. 
</p>
<p class="margin-large">
<sup>9</sup>　It is attributed to Gnlileo. 
</p>
<p>
It is true, of course, that physics chooses certain mathematical concepts 
for the formulation of the laws of nature, and surely only a fraction of all 
mathematical concepts is used in physics. It is true also that the concepts 
which were chosen were not selected arbitrarily from a listing of mathematical 
terms but were developed, in many if not most cases, independently by the 
physicist and recognized then as having been conceived before by the 
mathematician. It is not true, however, as is so often stated, that this had 
to happen because mathematics uses the simplest possible concepts and 
these were bound to occur in any formalism. As we saw before, the concepts 
of mathematics are not chosen for their conceptual simplicity-even se-
quences of pairs of numbers are far from being the simplest concepts-but 
for their amenability to clever manipulations and to striking, brilliant 
arguments. Let us not forget that the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics 
is the complex Hilbert space, with a Hermitean scalar product. Surely 
to the unpreoccupied mind, complex numbers are far from natural or simple 
and they cannot be suggested by physical observations. Furthermore, the 
use of complex numbers is in this case not a calculational trick of applied 
mathematics but comes close to being a necessity in the formulation of 
the laws of quantum mechanics. Finally, it now begins to appear that not 
only numbers but so-called analytic functions are destined to play a decisive 
role in the formulation of quantum theory. I am referring to the rapidly 
developing theory of dispersion relations. 
</p><p>
It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us here, 
quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the human mind 
can string a thousand arguments together without getting itself into contra- 
dictions or to the two miracles of the existence of laws of nature and of the 
human mind’s capacity to divine them. The observation which comes 
closest to an explanation for the mathematical concepts’ cropping up in 
physics which I know is Einstein’s statement that the only physical theories 
which we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones. It stands to argue that 
the concepts of mathematics, which invite the exercise of so muchwit, have the 
quality of beauty. However, Einstein’s observation can at best explain prop- 
erties of theories which we are willing to believe and has no reference to the in- 
trinsic accuracy of the theory. We shall, therefore, turn to thislatter question. 


</p><p>
Is the Success of Physical Theories Truly SzGrPrising? A possible ex-
planation of the physicist’s use of mathematics to formulate his laws of 
nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible person. As a result, when he 
finds a connection between two quantities which resembles a connection 
well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the conclusion that the 
connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know 
of any other similar connection. It is not the intention of the present dis-
cussion to refute the charge that the physicist is a somewhat irresponsible 
person. Perhaps he is. However, it is important to point out that the math- 
ematical formulation of the physicist’s often crude experience leads in 
an uncanny number of cases to an amazingly accurate description of a 
large class of phenomena. This shows that the mathematical language has 
more to commend it than being the only language which we can speak; 
it shows that it is, in a very real sense, the correct language. Let us consider 
a few examples. 
</p><p>
The first example is the oft quoted one of planetary motion. The laws of 
falling bodies became rather well established as a result of experiments 
carried out principally in Italy. These experiments could not be very 
accurate in the sense in which we understand accuracy today partly because 
of the effect of air resistance and partly because of the impossibility, at 
that time, to measure short time intervals. Nevertheless, it is not surprising 
that as a result of their studies, the Italian natural scientists acquired a 
familiarity with the ways in which objects travel through the atmosphere. 
It was Newton who then brought the law of freely falling objects into 
relation with the motion of the moon, noted that the parabola of the 
thrown rock’s path on the earth, and the circle of the moon’s path in the 
sky, are particular cases of the same mathematical object of an ellipse 
and postulated the universal law of gravitation, on the basis of a single, 
and at that time very approximate, numerical coincidence. Philosophically, 
the law of gravitation as formulated by Newton was repugnant to his time 
and to himself. Empirically, it was based on very scanty observations. 
The mathematical language in which it was formulated contained the con-
cept of a second derivative and those of us who have tried to draw an 
osculating circle to a curve know that the second derivative is not a very 
immediate concept. The law of gravity which Newton reluctantly estab-
lished and which he could verify with an accuracy of about 4 % has 
proved to be accurate to less than a ten thousandth of a per cent and became 
so closely associated with the idea of absolute accuracy that only recently 
did physicists become again bold enough to inquire into the limitations of 
its accuracy.<sup>10</sup> Certainly, the example of Newton’s law, quoted over 
and over again, must be mentioned first as a monumental example of a 
law, formulated in terms which appear simple to the mathematician, which 
has proved accurate beyond all reasonable expectation. Let us just re-
capitulate our thesis on this example: first, the law, particularly since a 
second derivative appears in it, is simple only to the mathematician, not to 
common sense or to non-mathematically-minded freshmen; second, it is 
a conditional law of very limited scope. It explains nothing about the 
earth which attracts Galileo’s rocks, or about the circular form of the moon’s 
orbit, or about the planets of the sun. The explanation of these initial 
conditions is left to the geologist and the astronomer, and they have a 
hard time with them.

</p><p>
The second example is that of ordinary, elementary quantum mechanics. 
This originated when Max Born noticed that some rules of computation, 
given by Heisenberg, were formally identical with the rules of computation 
with matrices, established a Iong time before by mathematicians. Born, 
Jordan and Heisenberg then proposed to replace by matrices the position 
and momentum variables of the equations of classical mechanics [S]. They 
applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few highly idealized problems and 
the results were quite satisfactory. However, there was, at that time, no 
rational evidence that their matrix mechanics would prove correct under 
more realistic conditions. Indeed, they say “if the mechanics as here propos- 
ed should already be correct in its essential traits”. As a matter of fact, the 
first application of their mechanics to a realistic problem, that of the hydro- 
gen atom, was given several months later, by Pauli. This application gave 
results in agreement with experience. This was satisfactory but still under- 
standable because Heisenberg’s rules of calculation were abstracted from 
problems which included the old theory of the hydrogen atom. The miracle 
occurred only when matrix mechanics, or a mathematically equivalent 
theory, was applied to problems for which Heisenberg’s calculating rules 
were meaningless. Heisenberg’s rules presupposed that the classical equa- 
tions of motion had solutions with certain periodicity properties; and the 
equations of motion of the two electrons of the helium atom, or of the even 
greater number of electrons of heavier atoms, simply do not have these 
properties, so that Heisenberg’s rules cannot be applied to these cases. 
Nevertheless, the calculation of the lowest energy level of helium, as carried 
out a few months ago by Kinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau 
of Standards, agree with the experimental data within the accuracy of the 
observations, which is one part in ten millions. Surely in this case we “got 
something out” of the equations that we did not put in.

The same is true of the qualitative characteristics of the “complex 
spectra”, that is the spectra of heavier atoms. I wish to recall a conver-
sation with Jordan who told me, when the qualitative features of the 
spectra were derived, that a disagreement of the rules derived from quantum 
mechanical theory, and the rules established by empirical research, would 
have provided the last opportunity to make a change in the framework of 
matrix mechanics. In other words, Jordan felt that we would have been, 
at least temporarily, helpless had an unexpected disagreement occurred 
in the theory of the helium atom. This was, at that time, developed by 
Kellner and by Hilleraas. The mathematical formalism was too clear and 
unchangeable so that, had the miracle of helium which was mentioned before 
not occurred, a true crisis would have arisen. Surely, physics would have 
overcome that crisis in one way or another. It is true, on the other hand, 
that physics as we know it today would not be possible without a constant 
recurrence of miracles similar to the one of the helium atom which is perhaps 
the most striking miracle that has occurred in the course of the development 
of elementary quantum mechanics, but by far not the only one. In fact, 
the number of analogous miracles is limited, in our view, only by our 
willingness to go after more similar ones. Quantum mechanics had, never-
theless, many almost equally striking successes which gave us the firm con-
viction that it is, what we call, correct. 
</p><p>
The last example is that of quantum electrodynamics, or the theory 
of the Lamb shift. Whereas Newton’s theory of gravitation still had obvious 
connections with experience, experience entered the formulation of matrix 
mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg’s prescrip- 
tions. The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by Bethe and 
established by Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory aiid the only 
direct contribution of experiment was to show the existence of a measurable 
effect. The agreement with calculation is better than one part in a thousand. 
</p><p>
The preceding three examples, which could be multiplied almost in-
definitely, should illustrate the appropriateness and accuracy of the math- 
ematical formulation of the laws of nature in terms of concepts chosen for 
their manipulability, the “laws of nature” being of almost fantastic accuracy 
but of strictly limited scope. I propose to refer to the observation which 
these examples illustrate as the empirical law of epistemology. Together 
with the laws of invariance of physical theories, it is an indispensable foun- 
dation of these theories. Without the laws of invariance the physical theories 
could have been given no foundation of fact; if the empirical law of episte-
mology were not correct, we would lack the encouragement and reassurance 
which are emotional necessities without which the “laws of nature” could 
not have been successfully explored. Dr. R. G.Sachs, with whom I discussed 
the empirical law of epistemology, called it an article of faith of the theoretical 
physicist, and it is surely that. However, what he called our article of faith 
can be well supported by actual examples-many examples in addition to 
the three which have been mentioned. 
</p><p>
The Uniqzteness of the Theories of Physics. The empirical nature of the 
preceding observation seems to me to be self-evident. It surely is not a 
“necessity of thought” and it should not be necessary, in order to prove 
this, to point to the fact that it applies only to a very small part of our 
knowledge of the inanimate world. It is absurd to believe that the existence 
of mathematically simple expressions for the second derivative of the 
position is self-evident, when no similar expressions for the position itself 
or for the velocity exist. It is therefore surprising how readily the wonderful 
gift contained in the empirical law of epistemology was taken for granted. 
The ability of the human mind to form a string of 1000 conclusions and still 
remain “right”, which was mentioned before, is a similar gift. 
</p><p>
Every empirical law has the disquieting quality that one does not 
know its limitations. We have seen that there are regularities in the events 
in the world around us which can be formulated in terms of mathematical 
concepts with an uncanny accuracy. There are, on the other hand, aspects 
of the world concerning which we do not believe in the existence of any 
accurate regularities. We call these initial conditions. The question which 
presents itself is whether the different regularities, that is the various laws 
of nature which will be discovered, will fuse into a single consistent unit, 
or at least asymptotically approach such a fusion. Alternately, it is possible 
that there always willbe some laws of nature which have nothing in common 
with each other. At present, this is true, for instance, of the laws of heredity 
and of physics. It is even possible that some of the laws of nature will be in 
conflict with each other in their implications, but each convincing enough 
in its own domain so that we may not be willing to abandon any of them. We 
may resign ourselves to such a state of affairs or our interest in clearing up 
the conflict between the various theories may fade out. We may lose 
interest in the “ultimate truth”, that is in a picture which is a consistent 
fusion into a single unit of the little pictures, formed on the various aspects 
of nature. 
</p><p>
It may be useful to illustrate the alternatives by an example. We now 
have, in physics, two theories of great power and interest: the theory of 
quantum phenomena and the theory of relativity. These two theories have 
their roots in mutually exclusive groups of phenomena. Relativity theory 
applies to macroscopic bodies, such as stars. The event of coincidence, that 
is in ultimate analysis of collision, is the primitive event in the theory of 
relativity and defines a point in space-time, or at least would define a point 
if the colliding particles were infinitely small. Quantum theory has its roots 
in the microscopic world and, from its point of view, the event of coincidence, 
or of collision, even if it takes place between particles of no spatial extent, is 
not primitive and not at all sharply isolated in space-time. The two theories 
operate with different mathematical concepts-the four dimensional Rie- 
mann space and the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, respectively. So 
far, the two theories couldnot be united, that is, no mathematical formulation 
exists to which both of these theories are approximations. All physicists 
believe that a union of the two theories is inherently possible and that we 
shall find it. Nevertheless, it is possible also to imagine that no union of the 
two theories can be found. This example illustrates the two possibilities, 
of union and of conflict, mentioned before, both of which are conceivable. 
</p><p>
In order to obtain an indication as to which alternative to expect ulti- 
mately, we can pretend to be a little more ignorant than we are and place 
ourselves at a lower level of knowledge than we actually possess. If we can 
find a fusion of our theories on this lower level of intelligence, we can con-
fidently expect that we will find a fusion of our theories also at our real 
level of intelligence. On the other hand, if we would arrive at mutually 
contradictory theories at a somewhat lower level of knowledge, the pos-
sibility of the permanence of conflicting theories cannot be excluded for 
ourselves either. The level of knowledge and ingenuity is a continuous 
variable and it is unlikely that a relatively small variation of this continuous 
variable changes the attainable picture of the world from inconsistent to 
consistent .ll

<sup>1l</sup>　This passage was written after a great deal of hesitation. The writer is convinced that 
it is useful, in epistemological discussions, to abandon the idealization that the level of human 
intelligence has a singular position on an absolute scale. In some cases it may even be useful to 
consider the attainment which is possible at the level of the intelligence of some other species. 
However, the writer also realizes that his thinking along the lines indicated in the text was too 
brief and not subject to sufficient critical appraisal to be reliable. 

</p><p>
Considered from this point of view, the fact that some of the theories 
which we know to be false give such amazingly accurake results, is an adverse 
factor. Had we somewhat less knowledge, the group of phenomena which 
these “false” theories explain, would appear to us to be large enough to 

‘(

prove” these theories. However, these theories are considered to be 
“false” by us just for the reason that they are, in ultimate analysis, incom- 
patible with more encompassing pictures and, if sufficiently many such 
false theories are discovered, they are bound to prove also to be in conflict 
with each other. Similarly, it is possible that the theories, which we consider 
to be “proved” by a number of numerical agreements which appears to 
be large enough for us, are false because they are in conflict with a possible 
more encompassing theory which is beyond our means of discovery. If 
this were true, we would have to expect conflicts between our theories as 
soon as their number grows beyond a certain point and as soon as they cover 
a sufficiently large number of groups of phenomena. In contrast to the 
article of faith of the theoretical physicist mentioned before, this is the 
nightmare of the theorist. 
</p><p>
Let us consider a few examples of “false” theories which give, in view 
of their falseness, alarmingly accurate descriptions of groups of phenomena. 
With some goodwill, one can dismiss some of the evidence which these 
examples provide. The success of Bohr’s early and pioneering ideas on the 
atom was always a rather narrow one and the same applies to Ptolemy’s 
epicycles. Our present vantage point gives an accurate description of all 
phenomena which these more primitive theories can describe. The same is 
not true any more of the so-called free-electron theory which gives a marvel-
lously accurate picture of many, if not most, properties of metals, semi-
conductors and insulators, In particular, it explains the fact, never properly 
understood on the basis of the “real theory”, that insulators show a specific 
resistance to electricity which may be loz6times greater than that of metals. 
In fact, there is no experimental evidence to show that the resistance is not 
infinite under the conditions under which the free-electron theory would 
lead us to expect an infinite resistance. Nevertheless, we are convinced that 
the free-electron theory is a crude approximation which should be replaced, 
in the description of all phenomena concerning solids, by a more accurate 
picture. 
</p><p>
If viewed from our real vantage point, the situation presented by the 
free-electron theory is irritating but is not likely to forebode any inconsist- 
encies which are unsurmountable for us. The free-electron theory raises 
doubts as to how much we should trust numerical agreement between 
theory and experiment as evidence for the correctness of the theory. We are 
used to such doubts. 
</p><p>
A much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could, 
some day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness, or of biology, 
which would be as coherent and convincing as our present theories of the in- 
animate world. Mendel’s laws of inheritance and the subsequent work on 
genes may well form the beginning of such a theory as far as biology is 
concerned. Furthermore, it is quite possible that an abstract argument can 
be found which shows that there is a conflict between such a theory and the 
accepted principles of physics. The argument could be of such abstract 
nature that it might not be possible to resolve the conflict, in favor of one 
or of the other theory, by an experiment. Such a situation would put a 
heavy strain on our faith in our theories and on our belief in the reality of 
the concepts which we form. It would give us a deep sense of frustration 
in our search for what I called the “ultimate truth”. The reason that such 
a situation is conceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why our 
theories work so well. Hence their accuracy may not prove their truth and 
consistency. Indeed, it is this writer’s belief that something rather akin ta 
the situation which was described above exists if the present laws of heredity 
and of physics are confronted. 
</p><p>
Let me end on a more cheerful note. The miracle of the appropriate- 
ness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of 
physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We 
should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research 
and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure even though 
perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning.

The writer wishes to record here his indebtedness to Dr. M. Polanyi 
who, many years ago, deeply influenced his thinking on problems of episte- 
mology, and to V. Bargmann whose friendly criticism was material in 
achieving whatever clarity was achieved. He is also greatly indebted to 

A. Shimony for reviewing the present article and calling his attention to 
C. S. Peirce’s papers.
